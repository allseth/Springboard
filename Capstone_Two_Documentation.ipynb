    "\n",
    "*Stroke is a serious medical condition that can have devastating consequences.\n",
    "In the United States, stroke ranks as the fifth leading cause of death and a primary source of long-term disability. According to the American Brain Foundation, every year, over 800,000 individuals experience a new or recurrent stroke, and unfortunately, at least 140,000 succumb to this disease. Can we develop a highly accurate predictive model for stroke occurence, utilizing a comprehensive set of patient data and advanced machine learning techniques?*"

This suggests that the model might be struggling to capture the nuances of these specific classes, potentially due to factors such as class imbalance or insufficient data. Further investigation and potential adjustments to the model or data preprocessing was needed to address this issue and improve performance for all classes. Due to the persistent error, I applied Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique, or SMOTE.\n",
